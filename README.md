# TV Hub

This is a demo site to demonstrate my software development capabilities.

TV Hub is a Nuxt SSR-generated website that shows the most popular tv shows.
It also shows the details about a particular TV shows, and allows you to search for shows.

This app was built with Vue 3 and Nuxt. It uses the [TV Maze API](https://www.tvmaze.com/api) to fetch data about TV shows.

Look at the [nuxt 3 documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org) to learn more.
